# Coursera Data Science Specialization - Predictive Modeling Course Project
Repository for the course project for the Johns Hopkins Predictive Modeling course.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which exercises monitored with accelerometers were performed. 

A full description of the source data used in this project can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).

## Project Summary
The following is a summary of the project instructions:
1. The classe variable is the variable to be predicted.
2. Any of the other variables may be used to predict with.
3. A report describing how the model was built, how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error is was created.
4. All choices made have been defended.
5. The prediction model was used to predict 20 different test cases.
6. The submission for the Peer Review portion consists of a link to a Github repository with R markdown and compiled HTML files describing the analysis.
7. The text of the writeup is constrianed to less than 2,000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5.
